RULE: A strong password requires

1) a minimum of 8 Characters
2) at least one UpperCase Letter
3) at least one LowerCase Letter
4) at least one Number
5) at least one Special Character
6) no sequence of 3 or more repeating characters
7) no out of range chars i.e. escape sequences < ord 0x20 and > 0x7f

    Your final activity is as follows:
    1) Assume the ValidateStrongPassword Function
       password for storage using the gen_pass_hash
       function.  Experiment with several test passwords 
       and print the resulting hash value.
    2) The gen_pass_hash function is susceptible to
       rainbow table attacks.  Therefore, you need to come up
       with a modification that will make the generated hash
       value more resilient to such an attack.
